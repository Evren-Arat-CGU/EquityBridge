1. Visit `https://equity-bridge.vercel.app/`
2. Click "Chat with AI" tab (should be active by default)
3. Mind Studio chat widget should appear
4. Test a conversation:
   - "I'm a health organization in Los Angeles"
   - "We need grants for disability services"
   - Agent should extract info and call backend API

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: BACKEND URL

**Make sure Samantha's Mind Studio agent is configured to use:**
- Backend URL: `https://ideal-flow-production-2795.up.railway.app`
- API Endpoint: `https://ideal-flow-production-2795.up.railway.app/api/match-grants`

**NOT** `localhost:8000` (that's only for local testing)
