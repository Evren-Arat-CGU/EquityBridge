## 🚨 CRITICAL MISSING PIECE

### **ArcGIS StoryMap is NOT done!**

**What needs to happen:**
1. Create StoryMap in ArcGIS
2. Add 4 sections:
   - Problem (funding deserts)
   - Solution (EquityBridge platform)
   - Demo (embedded frontend)
   - Impact (how it helps)
3. Embed deployed frontend: `https://equity-bridge.vercel.app/`
4. Add funding desert visualization (map)

**This is a core requirement for the demo!**

---

## 📋 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### For You (Evren):
1. ✅ **Test end-to-end** (15 min) - Form submission on live site
2. ⏳ **Accessibility audit** (30 min) - Verify WCAG compliance
3. ⏳ **Presentation practice** (30 min) - Rehearse demo

### For Samantha:
1. ⏳ **Share Mind Studio embed code** (5 min)
2. ❌ **Create ArcGIS StoryMap** (60 min) - **NOT STARTED**
3. ❌ **Embed frontend in StoryMap** (10 min)
4. ❌ **Add funding desert visualization** (20 min)

---

## ⚠️ BOTTOM LINE

**What's Done:**
- ✅ Backend deployed and working
- ✅ Frontend deployed and working
- ✅ Integration complete
- ⏳ Mind Studio (waiting for code)

**What's NOT Done:**
- ❌ **ArcGIS StoryMap** - This is a major missing piece!
- ⏳ End-to-end testing
- ⏳ Accessibility audit
- ❌ Presentation practice

**ArcGIS StoryMap is a core requirement and hasn't been started yet!**

---

**You need to create the StoryMap or have Samantha do it. It's a 60-minute task that's critical for the demo.**
