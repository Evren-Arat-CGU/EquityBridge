## 🎬 FULL SCRIPT

### [SLIDE 1: Title] - Opening (30 seconds)

**Speaker:** "Good afternoon judges! I'm [Name] from Team EquityBridge. We're excited to present our solution for today's hackathon theme: Health and Environmental Equity."

**Transition:** "Let me show you what we built."

---

### [SLIDE 2: Problem] - Problem Statement (45 seconds)

**Speaker:** "Health and environmental justice organizations face a critical challenge: finding grant funding. Many small nonprofits spend weeks searching through thousands of grants, only to discover they're not eligible or the deadline passed."

**Key Points:**
- Funding deserts exist in underserved communities
- Organizations lack resources to navigate complex grant databases
- Time-consuming manual search process
- Missed opportunities due to information gaps

**Transition:** "We built EquityBridge to solve this."

### [LIVE DEMO] - Solution Demo (2 minutes 30 seconds)

**Speaker:** "EquityBridge is a grant discovery platform that uses AI to match organizations with relevant funding opportunities. Let me show you how it works."

#### Demo Flow:

**1. Show the Interface (15 seconds)**
- "Here's our platform. Notice it's fully accessible - keyboard navigation, screen reader compatible, WCAG 2.1 AA compliant."

**2. Traditional Form Path (30 seconds)**
- "Organizations can use a simple form. Let me enter a community health clinic in Riverside, California."
- Fill out form:
  - Name: "Riverside Community Health Center"
  - Zip: "92501"
  - Mission: "Providing primary care to underserved families"
  - Focus: "Health"
  - Budget: "250,000"
  - Staff: "6-20"
- Click "Find Matching Grants"
- "In seconds, we get 5 highly relevant grants with match scores and explanations."

**3. AI Chat Path (45 seconds)**
- "But here's what makes EquityBridge special - our AI assistant."
- Switch to "Chat with AI" tab
- "Instead of filling out a form, organizations can have a natural conversation."
- Show chat: "I'm a small health clinic in Riverside serving low-income families. What grants are available?"
- "The AI understands the context, extracts the information, and finds matching grants - all through conversation."

**4. Results Display (30 seconds)**
- "Each grant shows:"
  - Match score (why it's relevant)
  - Amount range
  - Deadline
  - Eligibility requirements
  - Direct links to apply
- "Organizations can immediately see which grants are the best fit."

**5. Geographic Visualization (30 seconds)**
- "We've also integrated this into an ArcGIS StoryMap to visualize funding deserts."
- Show StoryMap (if ready)
- "This helps identify where grant funding is most needed."

### [SLIDE 3: Impact] - Impact & Future (45 seconds)

**Speaker:** "EquityBridge addresses multiple hackathon tracks:"

**Tracks Integrated:**
- **GeoAI:** ArcGIS StoryMaps for geographic visualization
- **AI/Coding:** Mind Studio conversational AI + FastAPI backend
- **UI/UX:** Accessible, user-friendly interface
- **Cybersecurity:** Secure API, input validation, XSS protection

**Impact:**

- Makes grant discovery accessible to all organizations
- Visualizes funding gaps to inform policy

**Future:**
- Expand grant database
- Add grant application tracking
- Integrate with more funding sources
- Mobile app development

---

### [SLIDE 4: Closing] - Closing (30 seconds)

**Speaker:** "EquityBridge democratizes access to grant funding, helping health and environmental justice organizations focus on their mission instead of searching for resources."

**Call to Action:**
- "We're open source and ready to scale."
- "Thank you for your time. We're happy to answer questions!"
