## 🔧 INSTALL CLIs (After Accounts Created)

Once you have accounts, install the command-line tools:

### Install Railway CLI:
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
```

### Install Vercel CLI:
```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

### Verify Installation:
```bash
railway --version
vercel --version
```

Both should show version numbers.

## ✅ VERIFY SETUP

After accounts are created and CLIs installed, run:

```bash
# Login to Railway

```

Both will open browser windows for authentication.
